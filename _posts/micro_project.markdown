A little bit about our project: We are going to use the San Francisco crime data from 2003 to May 2018. Here is the link to the [crime data][crime-data]. This dataset contains information about various crimes reported in San Francisco over several years. Each entry includes details such as the type of crime, the location where it occurred, and the date and time of the incident. By analyzing this dataset, we can provide insights into trends and patterns in criminal activities over time and space within the city.

Over the past few weeks, we have been closely studying this dataset and have discovered many intriguing insights into crime-related issues in San Francisco. However, I've always found the topic of drugs and narcotics in the United States fascinating. There have been numerous epidemics in the country's history, such as the [crack cocaine][crack-cocaine] epidemic, the [OxyContin epidemic][opioid-epidemic] , and today we face the [fentanyl epidemic][opioid-epidemic]. For this micro project, we aim to delve into drug and narcotics data from 2003 to 2018 to uncover interesting patterns and connections related to these epidemics. Let's begin by plotting the crime data concerning drugs and narcotics over the past years.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
