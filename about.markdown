<div class="about-text">
    Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Þórir Lárusson, and I've recently relocated to Denmark to pursue a master's degree in business analytics. Over the past three years, I delved into the realm of financial engineering at the University of Reykjavík, where my passion for finance ignited. This journey also sparked a newfound enthusiasm for programming and innovation, fueled by my engineering skills. I am eager to delve deeper into these fields and explore opportunities for future endeavors.

    In addition to my academic pursuits, I have spent the last seven years working as a plumber, where I developed a strong work ethic and sense of responsibility. Notably, I oversaw the installation of floor heating systems for four apartment blocks, a task that honed my project management skills. Alongside my studies and plumbing work, my family and I successfully flipped a 300-square-meter house within a year, further demonstrating my ability to balance multiple responsibilities effectively.

    Beyond my professional endeavors, sports have always held a special place in my heart. I had the privilege of playing professional basketball for the championship team KR for three memorable years. Currently, I serve on the board of a new basketball team in Iceland called KV, aiming to provide opportunities for young Icelandic players. While basketball has been a significant part of my life, I am also really passionate in golf, and I'm excited to discover the golf courses Denmark has to offer.
