A little bit about our project: We are going to use the San Francisco crime data from 2003 to May 2018. Here is the link to the [crime data][crime-data]. This dataset contains information about various crimes reported in San Francisco over several years. Each entry includes details such as the type of crime, the location where it occurred, and the date and time of the incident. By analyzing this dataset, we can provide insights into trends and patterns in criminal activities over time and space within the city.

Over the past few weeks, we have been closely studying this dataset and have discovered many intriguing insights into crime-related issues in San Francisco. However, I've always found the topic of drugs and narcotics in the United States fascinating. There have been numerous epidemics in the country's history, such as the [crack cocaine][crack-cocaine] epidemic, the [OxyContin epidemic][opioid-epidemic] , and today we face the [fentanyl epidemic][opioid-epidemic]. For this micro project, we aim to delve into drug and narcotics data from 2003 to 2018 to uncover interesting patterns and connections related to these epidemics. Let's begin by plotting the crime data concerning drugs and narcotics over the past years.

The calpolt offers a visual representation of drug and narcotic crime incidents over a period of fifteen years. This type of plot allows us to quickly discern patterns and trends over time. Where the darker spots revelie the more reportd crimes and lighter less.

Upon examinig the calplot, it is fascinating to observe the how the spike of crime drops in 2012 which is really interesting, this suggests a decreace in drug/narcotic crimes frequency. However the lighter color in the most recent years could also be due to incomplete data, which warrants cations because you never know if this could been less crimes or bad data, meaning the data is more sparse which could be due to delay in reporting but lets try to find something interesting. Also the plot shows that most of drug related crime is around 2007 to 2009 which is in the same time reange as the world finacial crash.

Also upon further investiagation I saw that that the drug overdoses spikes up around 2010 connting to the rices of Herion overdose deaths in 2010, and a antoher rise in synthetic opioid overdoes deaths in 2013 which indicates in calplot the crime rates are falling but not the overdoses which is pretty weird becuase I thought with more overdoes the would correlate together and then should have then more crime rate. here is the image and link showcasing the waves of [opiod overdoses][opioid-epidemic]:
