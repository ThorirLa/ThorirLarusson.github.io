A little bit about our project, we are going to use the San Francisco crime data from 2003 to May 2018. Here is the link to the [crime data][crime-data]. This dataset contains information about various crimes reported in San Francisco over several years. Each entry includes details such as the type of crime, the location where it occurred, and etc. By analyzing this dataset, we can provide insights into trends and patterns in criminal activities over time and space within the city.

Over the past few weeks, we have been closely studying this dataset and have discovered many intriguing insights into crime-related issues in San Francisco. However, I've always found the topic of drugs and narcotics in the United States fascinating. There have been numerous epidemics in the country's history, such as the [crack cocaine][crack-cocaine] epidemic, the [OxyContin epidemic][opioid-epidemic] , and today we face the [fentanyl epidemic][opioid-epidemic]. For this micro project, we aim to delve into drug and narcotics data from 2003 to 2018 to uncover interesting patterns and connections related to these epidemics. Let's begin by plotting the crime data concerning drugs and narcotics over the past years.

![Calender plot for Drug and Narcotics](/images/calander_plot_micro.png)

The calpolt offers a visual representation of drug and narcotic crime incidents over a period of fifteen years. This type of plot allows us to quickly discern patterns and trends over time, with darker spots indicating higher reported crime rates and lighter spots indicating lower rates.

Upon examining the calendar plot, it is intriguing to note the significant drop in crime spikes in 2012, suggesting a decrease in the frequency of drug/narcotic crimes. However, the lighter color in more recent years may be attributable to incomplete data, warranting caution in interpretation. The possibility of fewer crimes or data inaccuracies, possibly due to reporting delays, underscores the need for careful analysis.

Furthermore, the plot reveals that the majority of drug-related crimes occurred between 2007 and 2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis.

Upon further investigation, I observed spikes in drug overdoses around 2010, correlating with the rise in heroin overdose deaths, and another surge in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in 2013. This discrepancy between decreasing crime rates and increasing overdoses raises questions. One would expect a correlation between overdose rates and crime rates, yet the data suggests otherwise. This anomaly warrants further exploration to understand the complex dynamics at play.

For additional context, consider the image and link showcasing the waves of the [opiod overdoses][opioid-epidemic]:

Additionally, in an [article][most-common-drug] I found, the most common drug charge is the possession of marijuana, typically classified as a misdemeanor. This observation could potentially correlate with the decrease in reported drug-related incidents. Given that California legalized the possession of marijuana in 2018, it's possible that the popularity of marijuana wasn't being accurately reported in the later years, thus contributing to the apparent decline in drug-related incidents. While various factors could explain the observed decreases, this aspect is nonetheless intriguing.


Now lets move away from the calpolt and look into a different ascpect of the drug and narrcotic crime incitens and look into the districts in the San Francisco area. By doing this we could possible see insights into the where the most related crimes can be in the district. So by knowing where the crime is most seen, we can add more police to those districts. Now we are going to show
